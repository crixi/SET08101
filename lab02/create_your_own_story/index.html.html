		<p>Your standing in the middle of a rock concert. Your getting pushed and shoved into people. The music is so loud you don't have any room to think. A few minutes later you ask yourself why you are at this concert, then you remember. You are running from the police. You look to your left, right, up, and down, these officers are everywhere! You have two options: Either you crawl between everyone to get away or you crowd surf to the front of the stage.</p>
