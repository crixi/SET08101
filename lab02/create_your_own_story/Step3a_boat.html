		<p>You take the boat and you are on the way to an island. The breeze is cold and you become cold quickly. You arrive at the island and quickly get off avoiding any eye contact. The island is cold and the only light shining is the moon. You look ahead and you notice through the darkness that there is woods up ahead. You begin walking through woods and suddenly smell a fire burning.</p>
