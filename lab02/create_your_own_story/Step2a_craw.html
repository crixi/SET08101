		<p>You drop to your hands and knees and begin to crawl. People are stepping all over your hands and ankles. You keep getting stuck between legs and feet and are hoping to finally reach an opening. Successfully you make it out of the crowd and run towards the nearest exit. No officers see you. Relieved, you run through the exit and come to an opened limo door. No one is inside. You look around to see if anyone is watching you. In this moment, you notice an empty alley.</p>
