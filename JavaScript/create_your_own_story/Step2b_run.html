		<h1>Let's adventure!</h1>		
		<p>After running for 10 minutes, you bump into a little old man. He is holding up a sign that says "Help Wanted" and you ask him what does he need help with. He replies that he is a fisherman that has lost eyesight in his right eye. He needs someone to drive his boat to nearby island where he usually fishes. You agree quickly and begin to follow the man to his dock. He has to go inside for a second and hands you the keys to his boat.</p>
